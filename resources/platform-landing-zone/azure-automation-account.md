### ⚙️ Configure

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start / stop a runbook job (operator) | Automation Account | `Automation Operator` | Can start/stop/suspend/resume jobs; cannot view runbook content. |
| Start a specific runbook (limited) | Automation Account | `Automation Runbook Operator` | Can read runbook properties and start jobs for that runbook only. |
| Create / manage jobs (full) | Automation Account | `Automation Job Operator` | Creates and manages automation jobs without access to credentials or variables. |
| View job output and streams | Automation Account | `Automation Operator` | |
| Read runbook content | Automation Account | `Automation Contributor` or `Reader` | `Reader` can view runbook content; `Automation Operator` cannot. |
| Configure Update Management (enable on VM) | VM resource | `Virtual Machine Contributor` + `Automation Contributor` | Update Management deploys the MMA/AMA extension on target VMs. |
| Assign Managed Identity to Automation Account | Automation Account | `Automation Contributor` + `Managed Identity Operator` | The Automation Account's managed identity needs appropriate RBAC on target resources. |

## Operator Role Hierarchy

| Role | Create Runbooks | Edit Runbooks | Start Jobs | View Job Output | Access Credentials/Variables |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Automation Contributor` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `Automation Job Operator` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Automation Operator` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Automation Runbook Operator` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (specific runbook) | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Reader` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Notes / Considerations

- **Managed Identity** (system-assigned or user-assigned) is the recommended way for runbooks to authenticate to Azure resources — replaces the legacy Run As Account.
- The Automation Account's **managed identity** must be granted RBAC roles on each subscription/resource group it needs to manage (e.g., `Contributor` for update remediation).
- **`Automation Operator`** cannot view runbook source code — useful for giving Ops teams start/stop capability without exposing automation logic.
- **Hybrid Runbook Workers** extend automation to on-premises; the worker machine's OS account needs appropriate local permissions for the tasks being automated.
- Storing sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in **Automation Variables** (encrypted) or **Credentials** assets is preferable to hardcoding in runbooks.
- Link the Automation Account to a **Log Analytics Workspace** to enable Update Management and Change Tracking.
