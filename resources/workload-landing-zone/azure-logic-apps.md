## Overview

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based integration platform for building automated workflows that connect apps, data, services, and systems. Logic Apps come in two hosting models: **Consumption** (multi-tenant, per-action billing, `Microsoft.Logic/workflows`) and **Standard** (single-tenant, App Service Plan-based, `Microsoft.Web/sites` kind `workflowapp`). In a Workload Landing Zone, Logic Apps handle integration workflows such as data transformation, system orchestration, event routing, and business process automation.

## Least-Privilege RBAC Reference

> Logic Apps Consumption and Standard use different resource providers and RBAC models. Consumption uses `Microsoft.Logic` roles; Standard uses `Microsoft.Web` roles (same as App Service/Functions).

### 🟢 Create

#### Consumption

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create Logic App (Consumption) | Resource Group | `Logic App Contributor` | Creates a `Microsoft.Logic/workflows` resource. |
| Create Integration Account | Resource Group | `Logic App Contributor` | Required for B2B, XML, flat-file processing. |
| Create Integration Service Environment (ISE) | Resource Group | `Contributor` | ISE is deprecated — use Standard with VNet integration instead. |

#### Standard

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create Logic App (Standard) | Resource Group | `Website Contributor` + `Web Plan Contributor` | Standard Logic Apps run on an App Service Plan (`Microsoft.Web/sites` kind: `workflowapp`). |
| Enable system-assigned managed identity | Logic App | `Logic App Contributor` (Consumption) / `Website Contributor` (Standard) | |

### 🟡 Edit / Update

#### Consumption

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit workflow definition (designer/code) | Logic App | `Logic App Contributor` | Modify triggers, actions, and conditions. |
| Update API connections | Logic App + Connection | `Logic App Contributor` + `API Connection Contributor` | API connections are separate `Microsoft.Web/connections` resources. |
| Modify trigger settings | Logic App | `Logic App Contributor` | |

#### Standard

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edit workflow definition | Logic App | `Website Contributor` | Standard Logic Apps can contain multiple workflows per resource. |
| Update application settings | Logic App | `Website Contributor` | Connection strings and configuration. |
| Deploy workflow code | Logic App | `Website Contributor` | Supports Zip deploy, CI/CD pipelines. |
| Scale App Service Plan | App Service Plan | `Web Plan Contributor` | |
| Enable VNet Integration | Logic App + VNet | `Website Contributor` + `Network Contributor` | |

### 🔴 Delete

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete Logic App (Consumption) | Resource Group | `Logic App Contributor` | |
| Delete Logic App (Standard) | Resource Group | `Website Contributor` | |
| Delete API Connection | Resource Group | `API Connection Contributor` | Connections are shared resources; deleting may affect other Logic Apps. |
| Delete Integration Account | Resource Group | `Logic App Contributor` | |

### ⚙️ Configure

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Run / trigger a workflow (Consumption) | Logic App | `Logic App Operator` | Minimum role for triggering workflows without editing them. |
| View workflow run history (Consumption) | Logic App | `Logic App Operator` | View run status, inputs, outputs. |
| Read workflow definition (Consumption) | Logic App | `Logic App Operator` | |
| Manage API connections for Logic Apps | Connection resource | `API Connection Contributor` | `Microsoft.Web/connections` — separate from the Logic App resource. |
| Configure Key Vault References (Standard) | Logic App + Key Vault | `Website Contributor` + `Key Vault Secrets User` | Standard Logic Apps use Key Vault references like App Service. |
| Configure Private Endpoint (Standard) | Logic App + VNet | `Website Contributor` + `Network Contributor` | Consumption Logic Apps do not support Private Endpoints — use Standard. |
| Configure Diagnostic Settings | Logic App | `Monitoring Contributor` | |
| Configure Application Insights (Standard) | Logic App | `Website Contributor` + `Monitoring Contributor` | |

## Role Summary — Consumption Logic Apps

| Role | Create/Edit Workflow | Run/Trigger | View Run History | Manage Connections |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Logic App Contributor` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (needs `API Connection Contributor`) |
| `Logic App Operator` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `Logic App Reader` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (read-only) | ❌ |

## Notes / Considerations

- **Consumption vs. Standard**: Consumption uses `Logic App Contributor`/`Operator`/`Reader` roles under `Microsoft.Logic`; Standard uses `Website Contributor`/`Web Plan Contributor` under `Microsoft.Web` (identical to App Service/Functions RBAC).
- **API Connections** (`Microsoft.Web/connections`) are separate resources — `Logic App Contributor` alone cannot manage them. Assign `API Connection Contributor` to manage connection lifecycle.
- **Integration Service Environment (ISE)** is deprecated — migrate to Standard Logic Apps with VNet integration for network isolation.
- **Managed Identity** is the preferred authentication for connectors (Key Vault, Storage, Service Bus, SQL, etc.) — avoids storing credentials in connections.
- **Standard Logic Apps** can host multiple workflows in a single resource — use for cost efficiency and shared configuration.
- **Private Endpoints** are only supported for Standard Logic Apps — Consumption Logic Apps run in the multi-tenant environment.
- **Run history data** (inputs/outputs) may contain sensitive business data — restrict `Logic App Operator` and `Logic App Reader` assignments accordingly.
- **API Connection access** can leak credentials — `API Connection Contributor` can read connection parameters. Scope assignments to specific connection resources.
