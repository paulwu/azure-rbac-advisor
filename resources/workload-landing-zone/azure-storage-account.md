## Overview

Azure Storage Account is a multi-service storage platform providing Blob, File, Queue, Table, and Data Lake (ADLS Gen2) storage. This file provides granular RBAC breakdown for the **management plane** (account-level settings) and **each data service** (Blob, File, Queue, Table, ADLS Gen2). Roles are fundamentally split between **management plane** and **data plane** — management roles do not grant data access, and data plane roles do not grant account management.

## Management Plane — Storage Account

### 🟢 Create (Account)

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create a Storage Account | Resource Group | `Storage Account Contributor` | Creates the account with all default settings. |
| Create account with CMK encryption | Resource Group + Key Vault | `Storage Account Contributor` + `Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User` (on KV) | The storage account's managed identity needs Crypto Service Encryption User on the vault. |

### 🟡 Edit / Update (Account)

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Change replication type (LRS/ZRS/GRS) | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |
| Change access tier (Hot/Cool/Archive at account level) | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |
| Configure network rules (firewall, VNet service endpoints, private endpoints) | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` + `Network Contributor` | Network rules are management-plane; private endpoint creation requires Network Contributor. |
| Enable/disable public blob access | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |
| Enable hierarchical namespace (ADLS Gen2) | Storage Account | Cannot be enabled post-creation | Must be enabled at account creation. |
| Configure lifecycle management policies | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |
| Rotate storage account keys | Storage Account | `Storage Account Key Operator Service Role` | Minimum role for key rotation only; does not grant data access. |
| List storage account keys | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` or `Storage Account Key Operator Service Role` | Key listing grants access equivalent to full data plane — use with caution. |

### 🔴 Delete (Account)

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete a Storage Account | Resource Group | `Storage Account Contributor` | Deletion is immediate and permanent (unless soft-delete for blobs is enabled). |

### ⚙️ Configure (Account)

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure Diagnostic Settings | Storage Account | `Monitoring Contributor` | Per-service logs (blob, file, queue, table) are configured separately. |
| Configure Azure Defender for Storage | Storage Account | `Security Admin` | |
| Configure immutability policies (account-level) | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |
| Configure CORS rules | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | |

### 🔴 Delete (Blob)

| Operation | Scope | Least-Privileged Role | Notes |

| Full blob data access | Container | `Storage Blob Data Contributor` | Read + Write + Delete. |
| Manage ACLs / POSIX permissions (ADLS Gen2) | Container | `Storage Blob Data Owner` | Required for hierarchical namespace ACL management. `Contributor` or `Data Contributor` cannot set ACLs. |
| Generate SAS tokens via user delegation key | Storage Account | `Storage Blob Delegator` | Allows generation of user delegation SAS (time-limited, Entra ID–backed). More secure than account-key SAS. |
| Configure blob lifecycle management | Storage Account | `Storage Account Contributor` | Management-plane setting. |

## Notes / Considerations

- **Never use Storage Account keys in application code** — assign Entra ID data-plane roles to managed identities instead.
- **`Storage Account Contributor`** can list account keys which provides full data access equivalent to `Storage Blob Data Owner` — scope this role carefully.
- **Data plane roles** (Blob, File, Queue, Table) are completely separate from **management plane** (`Storage Account Contributor`) — this is intentional for least privilege.
- **ADLS Gen2** (hierarchical namespace) uses `Storage Blob Data Owner` for ACL management via POSIX-style permissions; standard Blob Data Contributor cannot manage ACLs.
- **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** generated from account keys bypass RBAC entirely — prefer user delegation SAS (requires `Storage Blob Delegator`) for time-limited delegated access.
- **Private Endpoints** for storage require separate endpoints per service (blob, file, queue, table) — see [Private DNS Zones](../platform-landing-zone/private-dns-zones.md).
